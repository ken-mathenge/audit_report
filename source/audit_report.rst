OBJECTIVES
~~~~~~~~~~

#) Evaluate the existence and completeness of any project management methodologies and practices.
#) Assessing adherence to project management methodologies and practices.
#) Ascertain whether Project Managers understand and comply with the existing methodologies and practices.
#) Assess the client’s satisfaction and project success in terms of: Schedule, budget and quality of work delivered.
#) Assessing the competencies of project managers in relation to the skills required to execute defined methodologies.

SCOPE
~~~~~

The success of IT projects can be measured by 3 opposing metrics: adherence to schedules, 
budget and quality of work delivered. The choice of and adaptation to project management methodologies 
balances these metrics for the most effective project implementation. Therefore the audit process should:

    * Assess chosen methodologies and how they fit into the projects context.
    * Assess the project managers competencies in executing the chosen methodologies.
    * Assess the subsequent effects the methodologies has in implementation of projects in relation to the 3 metrics mentioned above.

The audit is limited to evaluating the effectiveness of the project along these lines. Therefore, the audit entails:

    * Derivation of information from clients, project managers, and documentation of: planning, design and previous audit(s).
    * Evaluation of methodologies, competencies of project managers and subsequent effectiveness of implementation.

Being a leading software company in health informatics with susessful systems in production with the brand 
name **Slade360**, we decided to audit their project management procedures and methodologies that lead 
to them building successful systems. The audit, moreover, would seek to find out if there may be ways
to improve their methodologies.

AUDIT METHODOLOGY
=================

PRE-AUDIT PLANNING

AUDIT EXECUTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opening meeting
***************

We had a successful opening meeting with two project managers, Jospephat Macharia and David
Mwangi. Mr. Macharia is the heads the Backend development team and Mr. Mwangi leads the
Frontend development team of an ongoing ERP project. The team did a brief presentation on our 
audit objectives and the resources we needed. From the project managers most of the organization's 
documentations were confidential and indepth details about the projects since they were yet to be released
however, we were given the opportunity to speak to any member of the organisation who would facilitate us
to the best of their ability and within our academic scope.

Audit process
*************

The audit team split in conducting the interviews to cover as much ground as 
possible in a day. We interviewed the project managers and development team of the 
ERP project that was ongoing. Only details relevant to our school work were disclosed
to us. The team made multipurpose interview questions that were applied to both the 
project managers and developers in the team.

We followed these procedures in conducting this audit:

#) Interviews with project managers in various projects.
#) Interviews with the development team in a project.
#) Review documentations that have evidence of project management methodologies - Most
   documents are confidential such as the organisation's minutes and wikis, however we
   were provided with brief snippets of the general concepts of their methodoligies in
   the google slides used in the team's training.

**Interview questions we used:**

    #) Is there a defined design methodology that you’re expected to use when developing systems ?
    #) Is there an evaluation process for the system development methodology for individual projects ? 
    #) Is this design methodology strictly or loosely adhered to ?
    #) Are initial user requirements documented in any form ?
    #) Do these requirements mildly or heavily affect the eventual design ? 
    #) Are there any expected output documents from the various stages of the development process ?
    #) Are users included in the stages of the design process ?
    #) Are these documents kept for future reference in any form ?
    #) Is design a collaborative process or an individual one ?
    #) Are there any checks to ensure design specifications are followed through to implementation ?
    #) Is there a testing phase for the system to ensure the design of the system and its final form match up ?
    #) Do you think the evaluation and use of development methodologies improves the quality of projects ? 


Post-audit team meeting
***********************

After the process we had a brief meeting amongst ourselves to discuss the findings. We prepared
a draft summary that has been integrated into this main report that we used to make our final presentation. 
We presented our results to the team heads Jospephat Macharia and David Mwangi. They appreciated the effort
and assured us they would take a look at our recommendations. We were also thankful fot the opportunity they
had granted us to conduct an audit in their organisation. It was a great learning experience.


OVERALL ASSESSMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The organisation has been found to have sane and modern project management methodologies - **Lean** and **Kanban**.
These methodologies are supported by **Extreme Programming** methodologies where the developers use techniques such as
pair programming, test driven development, acceptance testing and continious integration that result in meeting the three
project management goal that are being audited - schedule, budget and quality. The organisation has a **Results Delivery Office**
that is headed by the project managers which set key achievable results that revolve around delivering software on time, utilizing
resources available such as buget and delivering quality software.

FINDINGS
~~~~~~~~

Finding for this report are organised based on the objective(s) they meet.

Evaluate the existence and completeness of any project management methodologies and practices
*********************************************************************************************

The organisation as a whole has project management methodologies and practices. From interviews with the project managers
and development team, and evidence from the google slides on the whole team's training shared and personal notes taken by 
the team in attendance the organisation recently shifted to using **Lean** and **Kanban** methodologies. Moreover, 
the team asserts that the organisation uses **Extreme Programming** methodologies such as: pair programming, t
est driven development and continious integration. We witnessed the pair programming in action where two developers were
working on the same feature using one computer. From the interviews too we established that code tesing is an culture that
has been instilled in all the developers as no code is ever merged without its corresponding test cases.

Assessing adherence to project management methodologies and practices
*********************************************************************

To ensure adherence to the project management methodologies and practices, the organisation has put in place
an RDO (Results Delivery Office) headed by the various project managers. The RDOs set **key results** which are objectives
that are to be met with respect to the project. RDO's include the scope of work to be done, schedule and budget. When they achieve
their **key results** the project managers and development team are given bonuses. The organisation has television screens that are used
as Kanban boards to keep track of the teams progress in development with metrics such as time and the budget.

Project managers ensure the adherance of practices such as pair programming. Every code that is written is stress tested by their
authors using unit testing, integrations testing and acceptancetesting. This is further enforced by the fact that the organisation
has a policy of test code coverage of 100%. This means that every piece of code written is covered by a test failure to which 
pipelines in continious integration in Gitlab actively fail.

Ascertain whether Project Managers understand and comply with the existing methodologies and practices
*******************************************************************************************************

Project managers are dynamically chosen form the pool of the organisation's Founders depending on their area of
expertise. The methodologies used by the organisation where formulated by these Founders earlier this year to 
facilitate progres in the organisation. Since they are the default project managers they enforce the methodologies 
to their development team members having in mind that they are the key shareholders in the organisation.

Assess the client’s satisfaction and project success in terms of: Schedule, budget and quality of work delivered
****************************************************************************************************************

Interviews with the companies clients did not happen due to unforeseable circumstances, however, from the RDO reports
on the Kanban boards the project teams achieve success in terms of the schedule, budget put in place and the 
quality of work that is predefined in the RDO's scope. The organisation has recurring clients such as Jubilee Insurance 
and UAP Insurance, who are big players in the insurance industry clearly indicating clients satisfaction. They also have
active contracts with major private hospitals such as Mp Shah, Aga Khan Hospital and Karen Hospital.

Assessing the competencies of project managers in relation to the skills required to execute defined methodologies
******************************************************************************************************************

As stated earlier, project managers are dynamically choosen from the pool of five founders based on their skills in 
fields such as finance and technology and competencies. From interviews with the development team this is reinforced. 
RDO reports from the various Kanban boards indicate success in projects which is a direct reflection of the
project managers competencies and skills to execute project methodologies and motivate the teams to achieve success.

CONCLUSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~

In conclusion, the audit was a great success. Most of the objectives from the audit program were met successfully.
The audit, moreover, was a learning success for the team of auditors. We not only got our experience in auditing but also 
learned new an amazing concepts such as those of **Lean** and **Kanban** and how they are applied in oranisations. The
organisation was very much welcoming and hospitable and provided us with information that we needed. However, in depth
details were confidential. Despite this we got adequate information to compile this audit report.

RECOMMENDATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The audit was a great success and most of the objectives were met. There is still room for improvement in the implementation
of some of the extreme programming practices such as **pair programming** which many developers frowned upon. Some of the 
recommendations we made are:

#) Allow all memebers of the organisation to have an equal opportunity to become project managers. This will help the team to 
   practise on their leadership and management skills. This we believe will make the process of handing down of the mantle of 
   leadership seamless.

#) Conduct more training with their teams on extreme programming methodologies. From the audit, it was evident that 
   practices such as pair programming where two developers work form on computer seemed very extreme and were frowned
   upon by most developers. The developers stated that they needed autonomy to work efficiently. We believe that there is 
   benefit in pair programming and more training on it would make the developers appreciate it more.
